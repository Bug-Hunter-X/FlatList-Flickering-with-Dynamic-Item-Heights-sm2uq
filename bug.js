This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items that have a dynamic height.  The issue arises because FlatList initially renders items with a default height and then updates the height as the content is measured. This can cause flickering or layout inconsistencies if the height changes significantly. The problem becomes more pronounced with many list items and complex layouts.
